## Description: 

The primary motivation for creating MyTeam-Page-Creator was to create a node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team and then produces an HTML webpage containging a summary for all team members defined.
The problem being addressed and resolved with this app is to create a simple webpage that contains links to each employees email.  In addition, it provides a link to the Github webpage for any employee entered as an Engineer.
By creating this app, I learned the following: creating objects that can inherit from a base class and creating tests that can be run from a command-line prompt.
